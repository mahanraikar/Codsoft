# 1. Churn Modelling
Predicting customer churn using classification algorithms by analyzing attributes such as credit score, geography, gender, balance, and tenure.

This project focuses on building a predictive model to identify customers likely to leave a bank. The dataset is preprocessed with label encoding and feature scaling. A Logistic Regression model is trained and evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

The workflow involves exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, splitting data into training and testing sets, applying logistic regression, and interpreting the results to improve customer retention strategies.

# 2. Credit Card Fraud Detection
Detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning models while handling class imbalance in a real-world financial dataset.

This project starts with data exploration and correlation analysis, followed by splitting the data and training a Logistic Regression model. As the dataset is highly imbalanced, metrics like precision and recall are prioritized over mere accuracy.

The goal is to correctly identify fraud without too many false alarms, making it suitable for financial applications where security is critical.

# 3.SMS Spam Detection
Classifying SMS messages as spam or ham using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

The project involves cleaning and preprocessing text messages by converting to lowercase, removing special characters, stop words, and stemming. The dataset is vectorized using TF-IDF, and models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM are trained.

Evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, and recall are used to validate model performance. The project successfully demonstrates how machine learning and NLP can be used to automate spam detection in text messaging.
